🚀 Project Update! 🛒🔍

I'm thrilled to share progress on Task-02 of our latest project: segmenting retail customers using a K-means clustering algorithm. 📊✨

Objective: Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchase history.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather detailed data on customer purchase histories from the retail store.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it’s ready for clustering.
Algorithm Implementation: Develop and apply a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors.
Cluster Analysis: Evaluate the clusters to understand the characteristics and preferences of each customer group.
Insights and Reporting: Generate actionable insights from the clustering results to inform marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
Excited to see how this segmentation can enhance our understanding of customer behavior! 🌟
